<h1>&lt;&lt;AugmentationApplication>></h1>
The AugmentationApplication stereotype is a specialization of Application that is always between a Property whose type is an AugmentationType Class and a Class. It represents a constraint on a NEIM augmentation property that limits the application of the property to specific types. When an augmentation property is the client of an AugmentationApplication Usage, this serves to constrain the NIEM types to which the augmentation property may apply. If the client augmentation Property is not in a PropertyHolder, then its Class must be a (direct or indirect) subclass of the supplier Class of the AugmentationApplication. If the augmentation Property is in a PropertyHolder, then any Property defined by reference to the augmentation Property must be for a Class that is a subclass of the supplier Class.

An AugmentationApplication Usage is implemented in a NIEM XML schema as an AppliesTo element in the annotation element of the property declaration represented by the client of the Usage, referencing the complex type represented by the supplier class of the Usage.
