<h1>&lt;&lt;AugmentationType>></h1>
AugmentationType is a NIEMType Class that represents a NIEM augmentation type. A NIEM augmentation type is a complex type that provides a reusable block of data that may be added to object types or association types. An augmentation of an object type object type is a block of additional data that is an instance of an augmentation type, added to an object type to carry additional data beyond that of the original object definition. The applicability of an augmentation may be restricted using an AugmentationApplication Dependency or an Augments Generalization.  A Class that is the specific Classifier of an Augments Generalization shall be inferred to be an AugmentationType.

AugmentationType is implemented in XML Schema as a complex type definition with complex content. Section 3.4 of XML Schema Structures addresses complex type definitions in XML Schema; Section 7.4.5 of NIEM NDR v1.3 addresses augmentation types in NIEM-conformant XML Schema.
