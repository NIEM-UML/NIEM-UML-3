<h1>&lt;&lt;ValueRestriction>></h1>
The ValueRestriction stereotype applies to a DataType (Enumeration or Primitive type) that is a specialization of a general DataType. It defines restrictions on which values of the general DataType that are allowed as values of the specialized DataType. A ValueRestriction DataType is implemented in XML Schema as a simple type definition that is a restriction of the simple type that implements the general DataType. The attributes of the ValueRestriction are implemented as restriction facets.

ValueRestriction represents a NIEM type which is implemented in XML Schema as a simple type definition. Section 3.14 of XML Schema Structures addresses simple type definitions in XML Schema; Sections 6.1.6.1, 7.2.1, 7.3, and 9.12.2 of NIEM NDR v1.3 address simple type definitions in NIEM-conformant XML Schema. The variety of the simple type definition may be union, list, or atomic. As the ValueRestriction stereotype is a specialization of DataType, it may be applied to Enumeration. In this case, the ValueRestriction represents a NIEM code type, which is implemented in XML Schema as a simple type definition that contains multiple xsd:enumeration facets.
