<h1>&lt;&lt;Union>></h1>
A Union is a DataType whose value space is the union of one or more other DataTypes, which are the member types of the Union. The member types are specified using UnionOf Usage dependencies.

A Union DataType is implemented in XML Schema as a union simple type definition. Each UnionOf dependency of which the Union is the client represents a relationship between two type definitions: the first is a union simple type definition whose member type definition is the second. This relationship is implemented in XML Schema through the memberTypes attribute on the xsd:union element of the union simple type definition, the actual value of which resolves to the second type definition. Section 3.14 of XML Schema Structures addresses union simple type definitions in XML Schema.
