<h1>&lt;&lt;XSDDeclaration>></h1>
The XSDDeclaration stereotype is a specialization of the common References stereotype. However, it is constrained such that its client must be an XSDProperty Property and its supplier must be an XSDProperty Property or a Namepsace Package. By default, the namespace of the global XSDï¿½property declaration referenced by XSDProperty is the namespace of its class. The XSDDeclaration stereotype allows the modeler to specify the namespace a XSDProperty will reference based on the namespace of another XSDProperty or the target namespace of a Namespace Package. Specifically, the client of the XSDDeclaration Realization shall reference the namespace indicated by the supplier of the XSDDeclaration Realization, the client of the maps to one of the following: an attribute use schema component or a particle component whose term property is an element declaration schema component. In the first case, the supplier maps to the attribute declaration schema component for the attribute use component. In the second case, the supplier maps to the element declaration schema component for the particle schema component.
