<h1>&lt;&lt;List>></h1>
A List is a DataType whose values consist of a finite length (possibly empty) sequence of values of another DataType, which is the item type of the List. A List DataType must have a single Property with multiplicity 0..* whose type is the item type. The name of this element is not material.  

A List DataType is implemented in XML schema as a list simple type definition. List represents a relationship between two simple type definitions: the first is a list simple type definition whose item type definition is the second. This relationship is implemented in XML Schema through the itemType attribute on the xsd:list element of the list simple type definition, the actual value of which resolves to the second type definition. Section 3.14 of XML Schema Structures addresses list simple type definitions in XML Schema; Section 7.3 of NIEM NDR v1.3 addresses list simple type definitions in NIEM-conformant XML Schema.
