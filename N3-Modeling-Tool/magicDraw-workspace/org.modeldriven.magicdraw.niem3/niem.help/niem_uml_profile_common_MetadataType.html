<h1>&lt;&lt;MetadataType>></h1>
A MetadataType is a NIEMType Class that represents a NIEM metadata type. A NIEM metadata type describes data about data, that is, information that is not descriptive of objects and their relationships, but is descriptive of the data itself. Metadata is specified as an instance of a metadata type and may include information such as the security of a piece of data or the source of the data. The applicability of such metadata may be modeled using MetadataApplication dependencies to one or more classes representing the applicable types.

MetadataType is implemented in XML Schema as a complex type definition with complex content. Section 3.4 of XML Schema Structures addresses complex type definitions in XML Schema; Section 7.4.4 of NIEM NDR v1.3 addresses metadata types in NIEM-conformant XML Schema.
