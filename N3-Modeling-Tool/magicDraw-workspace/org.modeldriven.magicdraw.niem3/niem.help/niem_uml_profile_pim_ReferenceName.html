<h1>&lt;&lt;ReferenceName>></h1>
 The ReferenceName stereotype is used on an Element that has a name that does not conform to the naming conventions required by the NIEM NDR or is otherwise not the desired NIEM name. The NIEMName attribute must provide a name for the Element that conforms to the relevant NDR naming rules for the specific kind of Element to which the stereotype is applied.
