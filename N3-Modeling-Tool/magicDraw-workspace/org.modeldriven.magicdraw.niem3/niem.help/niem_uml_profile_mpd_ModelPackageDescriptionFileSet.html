<h1>&lt;&lt;ModelPackageDescriptionFileSet>></h1>
A ModelPackageDescriptionFileSet Component represents a set of files in an MPD that are grouped for a specific purpose, function, or classification. For example, a set of MPD files might represent a schema subset, extension schema set, set of documentation, or set of test files. The MPD catalog uses the File element to represent artifacts, and the FileSet element to represent a set of artifacts. Note that both files and file sets are considered MPD artifacts. Reference Sections 4.2.3 and 4.2.4 of NIEM MPD Specification v1.0 (http://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/1.0/).
