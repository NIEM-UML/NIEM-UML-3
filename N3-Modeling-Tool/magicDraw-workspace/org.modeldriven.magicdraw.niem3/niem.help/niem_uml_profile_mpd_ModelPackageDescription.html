<h1>&lt;&lt;ModelPackageDescription>></h1>
 A ModelPackageDescription Component represents a NIEM Model Package Description (MPD). Specifically, it represents the information in an MPD catalog. Reference NIEM MPD Specification v1.0 (http://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/1.0/)
An MPD is a logical set of electronic files aggregated and organized to fulfill a specific purpose in NIEM. Directory organization and packaging of an MPD should be designed around major themes in NIEM: reuse, sharing, interoperability, and efficiency. The inclusion of artifacts in an MPD is modeled using a Usage dependency from the Component representing the MPD to the model element representing the artifact (most commonly a Namespace Package).
