<h1>&lt;&lt;ModelPackageDescriptionRelationship>></h1>
The ModelPackageDescriptionRelationship stereotype applies to a Dependency that represents a relationship between MPDs or between an MPD and another resource (such as a NIEM specification; as in the case of conforms-to). There are many ways one MPD may relate to another. This makes it extremely difficult to specify a fixed set of values that could objectively define an exact relationship between a pair of MPDs. Therefore, the optional descriptionText attribute is provided to further explain the nature of any of the eight relationshipCode values available (version_of, specializes, generalizes, deprecates, supersedes, adapts, conforms_to, updates). In some cases, the value of relationshipCode may be generic enough to require a more detailed explanation in descriptionText (for example, if the value is "adapts").
