<h1>&lt;&lt;Application>></h1>
An Application stereotype is applied to a Usage dependency between a client Property or Class and a supplier Class. It corresponds to the NIEM concept of "AppliesTo", which constrains the applicability of the client as being to the NIEM type represented by the supplier class. The Application Stereotype is abstract, its two concrete stereotypes being AugmentationApplication and MetadataApplication, representing the use of "AppliesTo" in the context of augmentation and metadata, respectively.
