<h1>&lt;&lt;XSDProperty>></h1>
An XSDProperty Property represents a NIEM property, which is implemented in XML Schema as either an attribute declaration and use or an element declaration and particle. If an XSDProperty Property is the client of a References Realization, then the supplier of the Realization defines the declaration of the NIEM property. Otherwise, the declaration of the NIEM property is defined implicitly to be the top-level attribute or element definition of the same name within the target namespace of the Namespace Package that contains the XSDProperty Property. All NIEM properties represented by XSDProperty Properties with the same name within the same package that are not clients of References Realizations share the same implicit attribute or element declaration.
