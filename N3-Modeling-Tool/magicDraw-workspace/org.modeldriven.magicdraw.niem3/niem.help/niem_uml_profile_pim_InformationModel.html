<h1>&lt;&lt;InformationModel>></h1>
 The contents of an InformationModel Package provide a platform-independent perspective on the structure of information to be exchanged in NIEM messages. Such a model is always taken to represent a NIEM namespace, but it may also be given a default purpose as modeled, independent of the implementation of that namespace. This allows a modeler to identify the intended purposes (e.g., reference, subset, exchange, etc.) of various information models within a set, without having to create a complete MPD model for the set.
