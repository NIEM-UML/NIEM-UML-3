We want an emf/xsd model for schematron.
Schematron is published in the form of a relax NG schema (compact syntax).
We need to convert this to xsd, then build an emf/xsd model from that.

We use trang to convert relax NG schema to xsd, via ant script; 
the source file, ant script, and conversion tools are located in the relaxng folder;
the result xsd is placed in the xsd folder.  This is a one time build.

Use xsd to create a "new" genmodel for schematron, namespace.  
There may be some problems with the schematron schema, including overlapping definitions.
This may result in some fabricated names within ecore model, but we will try to live with that.
Result is, in addition to genmodel, xsd2ecore, schematron.ecore and namespace.ecore.

Open schematron.genmodel and gen java model code.  This will also update plugin.xml as required.

Use Export from plugin.xml to create jar and put into org.modeldriven.emf.niem/dropins.
From there, copy to niem-uml plugin library, include in resource file, plugin, and project libraries.
Copy to eclipse dropins; restart eclipse.
The schematron should now be available to qvt.
